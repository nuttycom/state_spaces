# The Problem

<div class="incremental"><div>
* Programming is hard, maintenance is harder.
* Churn and inflexibility are a problem.

* So how to fix it?
    * Write down small, general facts about the universe.
    * Compose small facts to obtain more specific results.
    * Use good tools to check that we've written things down right.
</div></div>

<div class="notes">

A few years ago I wrote a piece of software, and had set up deployment for it
using Docker. Just a little thing, it ran on a DigitalOcean instance, standard
app + database + nginx sort of configuration. When I went to freshen it up a
bit, I found that basically nothing in the build or deployment infrastructure I
had set up worked any more - the build system's dependency resolution mechanism
(a standard 3rd-party component) had had a bug some time in the past few years
that meant I could no longer download some of the dependencies, the Docker base
images that I had used were no longer able to install the updated build
tooling; basically nothing worked. It took me a solid week of evenings to get
it all just to be deployable again - and this is with essentially no changes
to the code.

Our industry is kind of broken in the way that we think about software. We
expect it to break, to need to be replaced all the time. Now, in some sense
this is good; we should be continuously evolving and moving forward. But at
the same time, operations that are semantically the same shouldn't require
updating; if you've written down a fact about what you want to happen, that
fact doesn't change.

So what can we do? I think that what is required is just a small shift in
how we think about the programs that we're writing.

* Never use strings.

# Types as sets of operations

> * If you have a value of a type, you have access to all the operations defined

> * A lot of the time, most of those operations are not sensible given the context.
> * In order to reduce the operations available in a given scope to a manageable
>   set, we have two good tools: newtypes, and parametricity.

# Newtypes

>   exposes too many operations! If you left-shift an IP address, you get
>   something that is no longer an IP address, or at least doesn't have a
>   meaningful relationship to the original.

> * ~~~rust

# Newtypes

~~~rust
struct IpAddr(String)

impl IpAddr {
  fn maskWith(i: u32) -> u32 { ... }
}
~~~

A `String` is obviously a lousy representation for an IP address,
but if it supports the operations that we need, we don't really care.

# Parametricity

~~~rust
fn identity<A>(a: &A): &A
~~~

> * Parametricity allows us to forbid the implementation of a function
>   from performing any operations on a value for which we were not
